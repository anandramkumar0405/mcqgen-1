# MCQ Generator

## Introduction
This project aims to automate the process of generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using Generative AI techniques. Users can upload a text file containing relevant content, and our system utilizes Streamlit for the frontend, Python for backend processing, LangChain, LLM (Large Language Models), ChatGPT, and SequentialChain for generating MCQs. The entire system is deployed on AWS EC2 using MLOps methodologies for seamless integration and deployment.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Users can upload text files containing the content for which MCQs need to be generated.
- **Generative AI**: Leveraging advanced AI models including LangChain, LLM, ChatGPT, and SequentialChain for MCQ generation.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly frontend powered by Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **AWS EC2 Deployment**: The system is deployed on AWS EC2 for scalability and reliability.
- **MLOps Integration**: Utilizing MLOps practices for continuous integration and deployment.
